# tkinter-calculator
This is a small project - 'Tkinter Calculator'. I gave it the basic functionalities every calculator software has (with some known issues mentioned in the issues section). I started working on this project on 11th of November, 2021 and completed it on 20th of November, 2021. I'm not currently maintaining the source code but it'll always be freely available here on GitHub as an open-source project and will be always open to your contributions.
